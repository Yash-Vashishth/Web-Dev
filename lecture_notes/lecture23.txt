1. Authentication and Authorization
    -- Authentiction : deals with the identification
    -- Authorization : deals with the tasks to perform 

    --passwords are encrypted before being saved in DB

2. Encryption and Hashing
    -- Encryption : 
        - This is when a data string is converted into a series of numbers of letters legible to only the othersystem which recognizes this stream
        - THis is a 2 way operation (can be decrypted)
    -- Hashing 
        -- This is a 1 way operation (not decipherable)
        - used in password storing
        -- it slength remains fixed no matter th length the data
        --small change in i/p, large change in o/p 
        -- same input gives the samepii

    -- Use bcrypt library for passowrd hashing 
    -- Salt ad SaltRounds
        - Salt is the unique string added to password to enhance safety when password decryption is the same
        - SaltRounds - no;. of times data is hashedper sec or time/hash
    
    --process.env. SALT_ROUNDS = (no.of saltRounds)
    
    --bcrypt
        - .hash()
        -.compare()
    
    -- jwt (JSON Web Token)
        - encryption
        - npm i jsonwebtoken
        - .sign({},process.env.JWT_SECRET) -- creates a web token at frontend level
        - .verify(token,process.env.JWT_SECRET)
    
    -- req has 2 parts - header and body
    -- tokens are contained in the req.headers section

4. Checks when returning obj item 
    obj ={
        a:{
            b:{
                c:{
                    d:{

                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    -- if at some point obj.a.b returns undefined then error will be returned at obj.a.b.c
    -- To establish checks without using loop we use it as obj?.a?.b?.c

5. Single Sign-On Applications
6.Token v/s Refresh Token
    -- Tokens have an expiry . for eg. 10min or 15min
    --Refresh Token 

7. Third PARTY Authentication
    - In this hashing occurs , first at the main website where information is to be requested from.
    - Ecommerce backend sends two APIs , which are converted in base64 encoding to a token which is sent to the website with details for logging in which sends the "OK" signal for login
    - OAuth is used in communication between 2 backend services 

8. HW 
    - Create CRUD for review,routes
    - create middleware for checking in product controller  for seller id before allowing creation of product
