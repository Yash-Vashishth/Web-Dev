1. For Backend we need to create 
    a. Database (preferably cloud based) connection
    b. Models (for data input)
    c. routes 
    d. controllers (functions used while taking in data  input)
    e. Utils - common functions

2. module.exports is an object so to avoid circular dependency error we use it in func definition to avoid error 

3. Circular Dependency
    Let there be files A and B.If A uses functions of B and B uses functions of A then it is a cirular dependency
    Sometimes these can cause an error where functions used in either direction are shown as null values during usage 

    to avoid this we use module.exports.(func_name) to avoid this. In next.js we use fowardRef()

4. For passing image into backend we use Multer library to pass image link into backend

5. for storing images and getting links to use in backend we use
    a. S3Bucket (AWS)
    b. Block Bucket (Azure)
    c. Cloudinary (Free service, login based)

6. service : calls db interaction functions into controller 
    repo : repository layer interaction which consists of all the different queries and response cases for interaction with db

7.   req            --->            --->         --->
            router      controller      service     repo
     res           <---            <---         <---

8. Middleware
    -->Acts between route and controller
    --> Has response to both req and res 
    --> exexcutes tsk that need to be done before controller function is executed

    --> Express is a series of mdiddlewares

    --> executes before controller
    --> function loggin(req,res,next){
        console.log("hello");
        return res.send()
        next();
    }

    --> next() - is used to execute the next function/controller/mdiddleware.
    --> either mounted in router in unput calling or in the 
    
9. Joi and Zod are two different ibraries used in validating requests, schema desciption and data validator
10. Joi --> application-level validation        while        Mongoose --> datbase-level-validation 

11. In case of error present in details entered at middleware level it shows error at frontend level itself with 400 error
12. Joi has its own schema which is passed for checking the validity of the the data passed at frontend level
