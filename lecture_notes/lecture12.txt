1. Prototypes Revision
    --Function,Boolean,Array,Object, Number,String etc are all prototypes perviously defined in the webAPI section and under window
    --chaining of two different prototypes to assign values from one to another
    --Eg  Binding of two different prototypes to utilize their respective funtions tgether
        Cuboid.prototype = Object.create(Rectangle.prototype);
    
2. Class Syntax
    --defined in java language way
    --with 'set' keyword we set the value of parameters passed in the class
    --with 'get' keyword it becomes a property instead of a function
        eg. get Length(){
                return this.length
            }                                   is called by r.Length
    --with 'static' keyword it becomes a function
        eg.  static Length(){
                return this.length
            }                                   is called by r.Length() 

3. Callbacks
    -- logic is a callback function used while defining the property of the function. It is used as a substitute to the function that will
        actually be passed in the argument.

4. Ways to write async function in synchronous-
    a. Callbacks
    b. Promises
    c. async-await
