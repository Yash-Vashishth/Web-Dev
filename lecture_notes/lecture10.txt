1. Arrow Functions
 a. similar to normal functions but allows esy usage of functions statements in development and i also clean in ui
 b. all the steps in the file are correct and can be used as declaration for the functions

2. let, var, const
    --> JS ES6 (ecmascript 6)- it had only var and no tyoe declaration(eg b=10)
    --> ES6+ has added let and const to it 

    |                   |       var     |       let     |       const   |
    |    redeclaration  |       yes     |       no      |       yes     |
    |  reinitialization |       yes     |       yes     |       no      |
    |  scope            |   functional  |       block   |       block   | 
    |   hoist           |   yes         |  yes but DTZ  |  yes but DTZ  |

    DTZ- Dead Temporal Zone --> data not accessible

    if neither var, let or const is specified as type of varible it will be a variable with global scope 

3. Array Methods
    a. array.forEach(callback_function(a),index) = returns
