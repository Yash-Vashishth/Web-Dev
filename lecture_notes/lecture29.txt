1. React has a problem 
    Props and states passed from the chain down through a file system increase complexity of code and increase rendering of the file down the line 
    This slows down the application

    Solution: ContextAPI which gives providers folder and specifies the states and props used throughout the file in it 
                THis is useful only for small scale application

                For large scale Application we use GTK module 

2. Problem with ContextAPI : Each change in state rerenders all the components that use that state in them thus slowing this while application down
                            Solution: This is resolved by Redux TOolkit


3. {children} returns all the elements called inside the component in one file to the component's definition in another

4. TodoProvider is used to enclose the <App /> which allows the states to be used globally
5. useContext and createContext used to specify states
