1. React has a problem 
    Props and states passed from the chain down through a file system increase complexity of code and increase rendering of the file down the line 
    This slows down the application

    Solution: ContextAPI which gives providers folder and specifies the states and props used throughout the file in it 
                THis is useful only for small scale application

                For large scale Application we use GTK module 

2. Problem with ContextAPI : Each change in state rerenders all the components that use that state in them thus slowing this while application down
                            Solution: This is resolved by Redux TOolkit


3. {children} returns all the elements called inside the component in one file to the component's definition in another

4. TodoProvider is used to enclose the <App /> which allows the states to be used globally
5. useContext and createContext used to specify states 

6. SysMind
7. Redux Toolkit (rtk)
    this allows creation of actions in the form of functions which are sent through the dispatch to the reducer for execution of functions

8. const counterSlice = createSlice({
    name: "counter" ,
    initialState : {value:0},
    reducers : {
        increment
    }
})
    Q. How does React allow changing of state directly through change in the value?
    Immer package in the npm allows redux toolkit to directly change the vlue of a state in a function 


9. Generally state of a element in React can't be changed but this immer package creates an immmutable skill tree to change the value of the state

10. action creaters passed in dispatch send the actions with command through the following syntax 
    {
        type:
        payload: 
    }

11. Flow of state in redux

    creation (in slice named folder) --> action creaters exported ---> dispatch function(created by redux) used in passing actions 
    ---> reducers (perform the action and render the component) --> UI output
