1. Intro to Sockets (k now clients-erver architecture and req-res scheme)
    - If failure on first requet call, HTTP cnnot send res without request being sent again
    -Longpolling 
        -- When code is sdent first for execution it is ust accepted by the server at first before execution.
        -- Then the client requests from the server repeatedly to get a negative response till the code is executed successfully
        -- this repeated server call is called  HTTP Longpolling.
        -- Longpolling slows down the connection b repeated calls and is used only when short term connection is required.
    
    - Websockets
        -- Instead of repeated HTTP calls , a pipeline is created to allow data to allow a dedicated connection between client and server
            to make simple single call to send or retrieve data
    

2.  --Nestjs (express|fastify with class definition)
    -- we use http server because it is a pure node based library
    -- app.use(express.static()) -- Middlewre that is used to get files from frontend without adding route at the backend 

3. Socket io
    -- .on() - to listen for input , .emit() - to send data as output
    -- definition of socket in index.html is used (when we don't use axios to access socket and instead want a connection to )
        <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
    
    -- socket is then used in the js file with other frontend functionalities.
    -- Socket function defined in index.js is defined again at the script.js(client) level again to allow client to understand function used in server at client-level

3. Cors is a security policy used to determine which server (backend/frontend) can access our server
    --  cors: {
            origin: "*"                     
        }
        This * means that all global servers are allowed access to this.
    -- we specify different links in this afterwards

4. React Introduction 
    -- Webpage(single static page)------->Website(n static webpages)-------> webapp(n dynamic webpages)
    -- 1. Reusable components
       2. Hooks (States,Effects)
       3. Virtual DOM
       4. SPA (Single Page Application)
       5. Dynamic Rendering
       6. Props
