1. Object Destructuring
2. Concatenating two arrays together with both spread operator and with concat()
    const arr1=[1,2,3,4]
    const arr2=[5,6,7,8]

    //const arr3= arr1.concat(arr2);
    const arr3=[...arr1,...arr2]

    console.log(arr3);
    output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

***Note- 
    1. JS is a single threaded synchronous language. It has only one colstack
    2. View Engine shows us the HTMl and CSS. THe actua APIs, JS functionality, and state Loading is handled by Web APIs.

3. Asynchronous Function-
    Functions/tasks/memory allocation are executed simultaneously together

4. Synchronous Function-
    Functions/tasks/memory allocation is read and executed in an orderly manner from top to bottom line-by-line

5. Execution of function occurs in 4 sections-
    a. colstack- this is where the execution occurs
    b. WebAPIs - medium used for making js/ function calls , waiting pt for functions to be executed 
    c. callback queue - order of execution is maintained in this 
    d. event loops - refreshes the colstack everytime to check if its empty or not. If empty,
                    callback queue is checked for any remaining function or memory calls
