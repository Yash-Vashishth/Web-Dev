1. React
    -- npm create vite@latest
    -- npm run build - this is the command that shrinks all the structure(done for developer friendly access) to a small file dist(with html,css and js) a shortened version with all programs written in it.
    -- in main.jsx the <StrictMode></StrictMode> command is for rendering components 2 times so as to not miss any rpoduction changes that could be missed in code execution
    -- main.jsx takes in components called in the App.jsx and that is rendered(or dropped) into the div named "root" of index.html 

    -- We know that in return we have to have one element only as eturning which is why we return <div></div> in all components and App.jsx
    -- To avoid this, we use fragment element to create a single parent element which will not add any extra element to the main code 

2. React Manipulation
    -- Esacape to JS 
        --const Person = (props)=>{
            <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
        }

3. Interview How is JSX running in the browser
    -- JSX is not running. When we run jsx, the babel compiler present in the file converts jsx into js and executes it as an executable js file
    -- without wrapper <button Onclick={clickHandler}></button> will give definiiton of function clickHandler
    -- with wrapper <button Onclick={()=>clickHandler()}></button>

4. Done tasks
    -- props
    -- COmponents reusing  (using <Person></Person> many times)
    -- Rendering an array/list using map function
    -- Conditional rendering ({(value_defined_outside) ? {output} : {else execute this}})
    --UseStates

5. State
    -- useState gives two values in array -> [{name},set{name}]
    -- Allows change to {name} wherever it is used in the html ui whenever set is used to change its value
    -- It triggers Rerendering of the whole Component
    -- It is using Reconciliation Algorithm to check for difference between the old state and the new State and then rendering the component again

6. Component Lifecycle
    i. Create
    ii. Mount
    iii. Update
    iv. Unmount

7. In Taiwind we first used class but in the jsx file we use className. this className is converted to class when babel interprets jsx file
