5. Important interview question   
    Without using Update and delete Method (app.update and app.delete) can we achieve the  update and delete operation

6. const app= express() --> creates a single instance of the server . if we create it in the routes again (since routes doesn't have a "app" connection ) 
                            it will create a new express instance which will be different from the prevous instance

    Solution ----> import userroutes into index file and then say app.use()
