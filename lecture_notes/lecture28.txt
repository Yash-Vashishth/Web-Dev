1. Batch Operations
    When we have function
        [data,setdata]=useState(true)

        getData(){
            setdata(false);
            setdata(true);
            setdata(false);
            setdata(true);
        }
        getData()
    --- If this is called openly it first sets the dat state as false then rerenders the component
    --- then the function , since it is called openly is called again, it executes and first line of function is executed again and rerendering is done 
        again and again in an infinite loop as told in last lecture
    --- to resolve this problem we use useEffect() in which the funtion is rerendered only once during the mounting 


2. Error
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

    const increment =()=>{
        setCount(count + 1)
    }
    const IncrementbyThree=()=>{
        increment()
        increment()
        increment()
        //or
        setCount(count + 1);
        setCount(count + 1);
        setCount(count + 1);
    }
    
    -- This sets the counter value to 1 for the first increment and rerenders it 
    -- Then it takes the previous state of the count for the second function 
    -- Since it has not been commited to the jsx file it takes previous value of count from declaration i.e. 0
    -- Then this is updated to 1 again 
    -- This is why IncrementbyThree only works and increments by 1 even for multiple calls 
    -- resolving it is simple 
        const IncrementbyThree=()=>{
            setCount(count => count + 1);  
            setCount(count => count + 1);
            setCount(count => count + 1);
        }
    -- This takes previous elements from the count declared in the preious line and updates it without problem

3. Incrementing two counter using same button
    -- Solution : write useState() and handleIncrement() function in the App.jsx file and have button for increment there only
                  just pass the count in the two <Counter /> in the App to get two different counter being incremented at the same time 
4. Incrementing two counter using different button
    -- Solution : Use <Counter /> in App.jsx two times to get two Cunter with increment 

5. Important 
    -- when we are making handler functions always write th function declaration as handle______(func name to perform here){}
        eg. handleIncrement
    -- when we are passing the function as props to a child we define the prop as on____(func name to perform here)
        eg <Counter onIncrement={handleIncrement} />
