2. To Do App
    Create a checking state in project to add a line through the list items when marked as completed 

3. useState Issue
    when we use axios to get product we get the products but the rerendering done for mapping products is giving an almost infinite 
    call which is waste of data and memory usage

4. useEffect(a,b)
    a=()=>{}
    b=[]   ------> Dependency Array 
           ------> always array pased in second argument
           ------> containes the states in which rerendering is to be done on change of states (useState names) specified in array 

    -Always executed when the component is first mounted
